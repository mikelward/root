.TH root 1
.SH NAME
root \- run a command as the root user
.SH SYNOPSIS
root
.I command
.RI [ argument ]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B root
runs
.I command
with root permissions in the current user's environment.
.P
It is a designed as a more predictable alternative to
.BR sudo ,
which sometimes changes
.B PATH
or
.BR HOME .
.SH OPTIONS
None.
.SH "PERMISSION TO RUN ROOT"
If the user running
.B root
is a member of group 0, permission is granted, otherwise permission is denied.
.P
Group 0 is usually root or wheel.
You can run
.B "root id -gn"
to confirm which.
.P
To grant
.I user
permission to run
.BR root ,
run:
.P
.RS
.B su -
.RE
.RS
.B usermod -a -G 0
.I user
.RE
.P
.SH "RELATIVE PATHS"
.B root
will not allow running any command that was found via "" or "." in
.BR PATH .
.P
This is a security precaution to prevent running the wrong program.
.P
For example, if your
.B PATH
is ".:/usr/bin:/bin", your current directory is
.BR /tmp ,
and an attacker has created a program called
.BR /tmp/ls ,
you will not be allowed to run
.BR "root ls" .
.P
To be safe, run your command as:
.RS
.IP \(bu 4
an absolute path
.RB (e.g. " root /bin/ls" ),
or
.IP \(bu 4
a path containing an explicit directory name
.RB (e.g. " root ./mycommand" ).
.RE
.P
Or remove "" and "." entries from
.BR PATH .
.SH "SHELL ALIASES"
To allow running shell aliases via
.BR root ,
you should add
.P
.RS
.B alias root='root '
.P
.RE
to your shell configuration file.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
If
.IR command
was successfully started, the exit status will be
.IR command 's
exit status.

Otherwise, the exit status will be as follows:
.TP
